I am a final-year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Technology in Engineering Physics with a Minor Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. My research interests include, but are not limited to topics in Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, and Time series prediction tasks. My long-term goals include developing robust learning algorithms at a fundamental level, with strong mathematical foundations. I also enjoy certain aspects of Computer Vision and have worked on a few projects in the past.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I take great pleasure in engaging in racquet sports, with a particular fondness for badminton. I also enjoy playing strategic board games such as Chess and Scrabble. I'm also a dedicated anime enthusiast, having immersed myself in over 50 anime series.
