I am a first-year Master's student at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland . I am currently pursuing my Master's in Science in Data Science. I have previously completed my B.Tech in Engineering Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay with a minor in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. My research interests include, but are not limited to topics in Optimization for Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Neural Architecture Search. My long-term goals include developing robust learning algorithms at a fundamental level, with strong mathematical foundations. I also enjoy certain aspects of Computer Vision and have worked on a few projects in the past.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I take great pleasure in engaging in racquet sports, with a particular fondness for badminton. I also enjoy playing strategic board games such as Chess and Scrabble. I'm also a dedicated anime enthusiast, having immersed myself in over 50 anime series.
